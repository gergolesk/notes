## What Does the Tool Do?

The Notes Tool is a simple command-line utility that helps you manage a collection of notes. You can use it to create, view, edit, and delete individual notes within a specified file. The tool also allows for the deletion of an entire collection if needed, making it an easy and efficient way to manage your notes directly from the terminal.

## Tool Usage with Examples

### Basic Usage

To use the tool, run the following command:

```bash
./notestool [COLLECTION_NAME]
```

- **COLLECTION_NAME**: The name of the file where your notes will be stored. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

./notestool mynotes.txt
```

This command opens or creates the `mynotes.txt` file. Once opened, the tool will display a menu of options for managing your notes.

2. **Show Notes**:

## Explanation of How the Data is Stored

The notes are stored in a plain text file specified by **COLLECTION_NAME**. Each note is saved on a new line with an associated timestamp indicating when it was last modified.

### Data Storage Details

- **File Structure**:
  - Each note is stored on a separate line within the file.
  - Example content of `mynotes.txt`:
    ```
    Buy groceries [Last modified: 14:32:10 18.08.2024]
    Finish the report [Last modified: 16:45:30 18.08.2024]
    ```

- **Adding Notes**:
  - New notes are appended to the end of the file, along with a timestamp.

- **Editing Notes**:
  - When a note is edited, the corresponding line in the file is updated with the new text and timestamp.

- **Deleting Notes**:
  - When a note is deleted, the corresponding line is removed from the file.

- **Deleting the Collection**:
  - If the collection is deleted, the entire file is removed from the system.

The tool automatically saves any changes you make to the notes, ensuring your data is preserved between sessions.
